I am a software developer with a passion for data analysis and machine learning software development. and I am currently learning about various data science tools and techniques to further my skills in the field such as:

- Data cleaning and pre-processing using tools like Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn.
- Exploratory data analysis using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing using tools like Statsmodels.
- Machine learning using libraries like scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Keras.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using libraries like NLTK

I am experienced in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, Docker, FastAPI, Flask.
